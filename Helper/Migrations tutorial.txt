PM> Add-Migration AddLogs
Scaffolding migration 'AddLogs'.
The Designer Code for this migration file includes a 
snapshot of your current Code First model. 
This snapshot is used to calculate the changes to your model
when you scaffold the next migration.
If you make additional changes to your model 
that you want to include in this migration,
then you can re-scaffold it by running
'Add-Migration AddLogs' again.
